# Contributing to Blocklists

This is a community project, primarily maintained by @hkamran80.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

Blocklists is open source, released under the MIT license (see the [LICENSE.txt file](./LICENSE.txt)).

We respect intellectual property rights of others and we want to make sure all incoming
contributions are correctly attributed and licensed. A Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO) is a lightweight mechanism to do that.

The DCO is a declaration attached to every contribution made by every developer.
In the commit message of the contribution, the developer simply adds a `Signed-off-by`
statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below or at [DeveloperCertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/).

```text
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
    best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
    source license and I have the right under that license to
    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including
    all personal information I submit with it, including my
    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
```

We require that every contribution to Blocklists is signed with a Developer Certificate
of Origin.

Each commit must include a DCO which looks like this

```text
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@email.com>
```

You may type this line on your own when writing your commit messages. However, if
your `user.name` and `user.email` are set in your git configs, you can use `-s` or `--signoff`
to add the `Signed-off-by` line to the end of the commit message.
